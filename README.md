# FTsim
A 3D simulation of the Fischertechnik training models with a connector to Siemens S7-PLCSIM emulator.

![Training models](https://github.com/nejci/FTsim/blob/main/FTmodels.jpg?raw=true)


The following training models are simulated:
- 3D-Robot
- [3D-Robot TX](https://www.fischertechnik.de/en/products/simulating/training-models/511938-sim-3d-robot-24v-simulation) (a 3D-Robot enhanced by encoders)
- [Indexed line with two machining stations](https://www.fischertechnik.de/en/products/simulating/training-models/96790-sim-indexed-line-with-two-machining-stations-24v-simulation)
- Pneumatic processing system

We developed FTsim using 32-bit Unity 5.3.4f1 ([download archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive)) that allowed us to import Siemens S7-ProSim COM object ([managed S7-ProSim library](https://github.com/TheFern2/myS7ProSimLib)).
